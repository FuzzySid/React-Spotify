# Fuzzy React Spotify

[Fuzzy React Spotify](https://fuzzy-netflix-clone.web.app/) is a simple clone of [Spotify Web Clone](http://netflix.com/) built using ReactJS and [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). ðŸŽ¶

Users can log in to their Spotify Accounts. ![Landing Page](https://ik.imagekit.io/pibjyepn7p9/spotify-login_KYf1NPf_D.PNG)



Spotify Authentication API authenticates the user and redirects back to our app. To manage user state, Global State is maintained using React's Context API.

Once logged in, users can see their playlists, play their songs trailers etc. All the playlists and songs data is fetched from Spotify API.  The project is deployed on Firebase.

This project demonstrates -

- Integrating external APIs for authentication and fetching data 
- Playing songs in browser using HTML 5 <audio>
- Cloning designs and UI from a popular website



## Setup and Running Locally

If you wish to run the project locally, follow the steps below:

Run the following command to clone the repository locally

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FuzzySid/netflix-clone.git
```

Inside the directory, run

```shell
npm i
```

To install all the dependencies. If you run into any errors while installing packages, run the following command instead

```shell
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

You'll then need a `spoitify.config.js` inside the `src` directory to get started. Add the following code inside it

```javascript
export const authEndpoint = "https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize";
const redirectUri= <REDIRECT_URI>;
const scopes = [
    "user-read-currently-playing",
    "user-read-recently-played",
    "user-read-playback-state",
    "user-top-read",
    "user-modify-playback-state",
  ];

  const clientId=<CLIENT_ID>;

  export const getTokenFromUrl=()=>{
    return window.location.hash.substring(1).split('&').reduce((initial,item)=>{
      let parts=item.split('=')
      initial[parts[0]]=decodeURIComponent(parts[1])
      return initial;
    },{})
  }

  export const loginUrl = `${authEndpoint}?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=${scopes.join(
    "%20"
  )}&response_type=token&show_dialog=true`;  
```

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `REDIRECT_URI` with the ones that you can generate from [Spotify Developers API Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).  



### Getting Client Id

You'll need to login through your account and create a new app

![Create a new app on Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://ik.imagekit.io/pibjyepn7p9/spotify_dashboard_P_-93439g.PNG)

After creating the app, click on it and you'll be able to see your `CLIENT_ID`

### Generating Redirect URI



To create `REDIRECT_URI` , click on **Edit Settings**.

 ![Edit Settings](https://ik.imagekit.io/pibjyepn7p9/Spotify_Client_id_1__8b3Sei-7W.PNG)

Inside the popup, go to the **Redirect URI** section and add a new **Redirect URI**. Make sure you add the url of your deployed project as well as the localhost domain where you'll spin your React development server. For example, I use localhost:3000 while developing React Apps so I have added it as a **Redirect URI**. If you don't add a Redirect URI, you won't be able to get back the authenticated user data from Spotify Authentication API.

Finally, run the following command to open a development server

```shell
npm start
```
